								<h3>CRG Collaborative Response Graphics</h3>
								<p>At Critical Response Group Inc, Collaborative Response Graphics present a complex design challenge. The need for clear, rapid, and accurate communication by emergency responders means visual elements must be simple but effective. These products also need to be reliable in real-time, high-intensity situations. To solve these problems, the Collaborative Response Graphic is designed to be geospatially accurate, incorporating high resolution aerial imagery with structural floor plans. These maps are further engineered with clearly recognizable icons and labels to facilitate user communication when it matters most.</p>

								<h3>Atom Bank Student Perks App Mock-up</h3>
								<p>In an externship with Atom Bank during a semester abroad, our team was approached by UX and Marketing with the challenge of envisioning a new product targeting university students. The idea for appealing to this demographic was a subscription-based rewards system where students could unlock discounts for stores and services. Each purchase with a promotional redemption would allow the student to work toward a cash-based reward from the bank. Working through the iterative design cycle we brainstormed and prototyped a concept application. Visuals were produced in Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator and brought together with Proto.io to create our final Mock-up within the 40 hours of allotted time. The final demonstration can be seen further <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXQhR0CgCuc">here.</a>

								<h3>Turbo Pinball Ultra</h3>
								<p>A Pinball Machine? In an era where digital gaming is increasing in popularity, does physical gaming stand a chance? For Senior Thesis, this was the question we sought out to answer with Turbo Pinball Ultra. The solution was to merge physical and digital, creating an interaction between traditional pinball gameplay with projection mapping for the visuals and display. The ball would interact with physical components and connections through Arduino, reading values into Unity. In the end, the static visual elements were designed in Adobe Illustrator and responsive elements in Adobe After Effects. Our presentation proved that there is a place for interactive nostalgia among modern gaming.</p>

								<h3>Interactive Trade Route Project</h3>
								<p>As a public entity with limited funding, the New Jersey State Museum was seeking solutions for modernizing their collection. The extensive number of field trips visiting each year were less focused when dealing with static information than the limited number of interactive items on display. There was a clear need to engage younger children through tangible design and implementation. Exhibits needed to be durable, simple, and low-tech. For our design, addressing these issues was critical. The final product relied on a simple push button to illuminate an LED light string on a laser engraved board, showing directional trade routes accompanied by a picture and brief description of items that could be found on display in the museum.</p>
